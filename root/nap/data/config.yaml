# HTTP services to configure for reverse proxy.
http:
  # Default is a special service that does not accept subdomains. It
  # has all other supported configurations. It is not required. If you
  # choose not to use "default", Nginx will return a 404.
  default:
    #cert: example.com

    # If you don't mount over /nap/www, it will be a generated
    # navigational dashboard (navdash) for the other configured
    # services. However, if there are no other services, it is a
    # simple "<h1>It works!</h1>".
    root: /nap/www

  # This is an example http service. You will likely want to remove
  # all comments (after reading) so you can copy/paste easier. See
  # examples/ for some "realistic" use cases.
  example:
    # You must configure exactly one target. A target is either an
    # "alias", "file", "redirect", "respond", "root", or "upstream"
    # key. See below for examples of each.

    # Similar to "root". See Nginx documentation on best practices for
    # alias vs root.
    #alias: /nap/www

    # Adding a cert enables HTTPS. This could be a cert from the PKI
    # section, or you can Bring Your Own Certs (BYOC). See
    # compose.yaml for examples. The format is <pki>/<cert>. If
    # unspecified, the <pki> defaults to "default". There are two
    # special cases for <pki>:
    #
    # The first is for BYOC. You can put your certs (Let's Encrypt,
    # ZeroSSL, etc...) in a directory and mount them to /byoc. Files
    # should be named <cert>.chain.pem and <cert>.key.pem. You can
    # then use them with byoc/<cert>.
    #
    # The second is for Let's Encrypt specifically. Let's Encrypt
    # appears to use a folder heirarchy like <domain>/fullchain.pem
    # and <domain>/privkey.pem. So that you don't need to move or
    # rename files, you can use letsencrypt/<domain> and NAP will find
    # fullchain.pem and privkey.pem in the /byoc/<domain> directory.
    # Make sure to mount your domain folders to /byoc.
    #
    #cert: example.com # Default PKI
    #cert: <pki>/example.com # Named PKI
    #cert: byoc/example.com # BYOC
    #cert: letsencrypt/example.com # BYOC with Let's Encrypt
    cert: example.com

    # You can add custom Nginx to the server{} block here. Be careful
    # as you can easily break things! Below is a commented example for
    # filtering on User-Agent.

        #if ($http_user_agent = "curl/7.87.0") {
        #  rewrite ^(.*)$ /hidden$1 last;
        #}
        #location ~* ^/hidden.*$ {
        #  internal;
        #  ...
        #  rewrite ^/hidden(.*)$ $1 break;
        #}

        #}';

    # This config option is optional but can be used to pin this
    # service to a particular domain. By default the generated Nginx
    # configs will listen on "<subdomain>.*". Using this you could pin
    # to "<subdomain>.example.com".
